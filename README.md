# Popup - Problem solving and Programming under pressure

This repository contains solutions to problems found on: https://open.kattis.com/problems
In most cases a file contains the complete solution for ease of submission.
This means that many files contain inner classes that are used in the solution.

Some solutions contain lots of last minute tweaks and are therefore vary messy while others are cleaner.

The algorithm package contain solutions to more general problems such as classic graph problems etc.
